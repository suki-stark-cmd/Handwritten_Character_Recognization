Handwritten Character Recognition
Welcome to the Handwritten Character Recognition repository! This project, completed during my CodeAlpha internship, focuses on developing a machine learning model to recognize handwritten characters. The model is designed to process and analyze images of handwritten text, making it useful for applications like text digitization, automatic form processing, and character recognition.

Project Overview:
The Handwritten Character Recognition project involves building a machine learning model capable of recognizing characters from handwritten images. By leveraging image processing techniques and training on a dataset of handwritten characters, this model can be applied in various fields such as document scanning, data entry automation, and optical character recognition (OCR). The goal is to create a system that can identify each character from a given image, even if the handwriting varies in style or legibility.

This Jupyter Notebook contains the full implementation of the project, including:

Data Preprocessing: Loading, cleaning, and preparing the dataset of handwritten characters for training.
Model Training: Training machine learning models (such as neural networks) to recognize handwritten characters based on the provided dataset.
Character Recognition: Applying the trained model to predict the characters from new handwritten images.
A_Z Handwritten Data.csv:
This CSV file contains a dataset of labeled handwritten characters from A-Z. Each image is represented as a flattened vector of pixel values (grayscale) corresponding to a specific character. This dataset is used to train and validate the model's performance on character recognition.
